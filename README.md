### Abstract
SpatiaList is a HoloLens 2 application designed for spatially persistent digital post-its in a Mixed Reality (MR) environment. This project, in collaboration with Microsoft, is intended to showcase the potential of MR technologies to enable multi-user collaboration scenarios.
SpatiaList maintains consistency across sessions, space and users of MR objects, which is not implemented out-of-the-box in current MR devices. The system architecture is designed to support persistence of holographic post-its, the core component being Azure Spatial Anchors (ASA). 
A GUI was designed (for MR devices) and on the Web (for non-MR devices). A user study with 16 participants has been performed to evaluate the app's performance. Spatial and session consistency was observed. In stable internet conditions, multi-user teamwork scenarios could be effectively performed.
The user study shows an overall positive sentiment, with key recommendations to provide more visual cues for the post-it creation step and to enable users to work on the same post-it simultaneously.
